## Travel insurance

- https://safetywing.com/ (testing now)
- https://www.revolut.com/ (40 days included in the Premium, cannot combine with other providers)

## Expenses and money abroad
Traveling can be really expensive. One advice for you: live like you do normally in your hometown. So if you are not used to visit restaurants every day - don‚Äôt do it in different countries. These links will help you to keep your eye on your money:

- https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/
- https://www.revolut.com/ (usually free withdrawals in different currencies)
- https://transferwise.com/borderless-account

## Mobile Internet
Consider if you really need it. It‚Äôs actually quite fun to travel without it because you need to step out of your comfort zone. But if you cannot be without it check this website:

- http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/Prepaid_SIM_with_data
- https://www.tripmode.ch/

Providers I actually tried:

### Peru

- [Claro](http://www.claro.com.pe/personas/) - 3 GB for 30 Soles (end of 2018)

### Mexico

- [Telcel](https://www.telcel.com/)

## Powerrr!

- https://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plug-voltage-by-country/
- http://www.skross.com/en/category/9/world-travel-adapter.html (robust, big)
- https://packhacker.com/travel-gear/kikkerland/universal-travel-adapter/ (small)
- http://www.skross.com/en/category/30/power-banks.html
- https://www.anker.com/products/107/Power-Banks

Protip: consider if you need a big powerbank (they are heavy). For example I have this one. Huge capacity but weight 340g - do you need such a capacity? :)

## The Problems in Remote Working

Issues are loneliness, ability to disconnect, distractions (cats on keyboards üê±), missing out on watercooler talk & poor quality communications tools. Also, remote members fear their work is judged more. https://medium.com/@rrhoover/the-problems-in-remote-working-1a6f165585d
